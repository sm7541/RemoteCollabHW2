# RemoteCollabHW2

Create github repo with readme.md then clone the remote repo to your desktop for to 
have a local repo. We want to branch the repo (main and testing), add a missionstatement.txt file to both, and then we want to 
update the testing repo's txt file until it is improved. Then we merge the testing and main branch in order to resolve the merge 
conflict and pick which missionstatement.txt we want
